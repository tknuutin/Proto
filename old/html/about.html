		<p class="info"><h2>What is Modme?</h2>Modme is a text adventure game in which you interact in simple natural language commands. These commands can be specific to the area you're visiting, make use of an item, examine game objects, or use player abilities. Some commands are listed in the info screen, some are combinations of verbs and targets known to the player, and some are completely hidden and are up to the player to discover.</p>
		<p class="info">The player possesses stats, skills, traits, and items. He may encounter many friendly creatures or angry monsters. He will also encounter items scattered around the game world. The game world can be silly, unpredictable, or even non-sensical with how the game world reacts to actions by the player.</p>
		<p class="info">Modme is designed to be completely modular. All game areas and entities can be added with a simple form and are added to  the database. It takes only a few minutes to create a simple area, but more complex scripts and events are also possible. Anyone can design a new area and it will be playable by everyone immediately in the Unverified version. It is possible for example to add new commands to areas created by others, or new outcomes to commands created by others, or new NPCs, or new random events. You can create an entire story or adventure game completely within Modme.</p>
