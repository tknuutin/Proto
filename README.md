Modme Proto
=====
A web-based text adventure game with an integrated content creator developed on Django. 
Modular design allows adding more content with simple web forms.

/new contains the new, streamlined prototype for Modme that is actively under development.
/old contains the old version which has code from many years back and is progressively awful code.

I don't have a good hosting solution yet so the server itself will only be up intermittently. 
When the server is up, it will be up at http://www.modme-game.net/proto/.

Under construction!
